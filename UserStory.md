We ask all of our candidates complete a little Rails challenge so we can get a better idea as to how you build an app based on client requirements. If you're up for the challenge, please see the details below.

***

A client of LaunchPad Lab is opening a movie theater. We need you to build a Rails app so they can open the new theater with online ticketing.

Customers should be able to come to the site, see all movies playing with their showtimes. Remember, seating is limited so a particular showtime should only have a limited number of seats. Once a show sells out, a customer should no longer be able to buy tickets. Also, the theater will be showing R-rated movies so make sure to check the customer's age before purchasing. They should be able to add tickets for only one movie at a time so don't worry about a shopping cart for this version.

When customers decide to buy their tickets, they should be able to checkout by entering their name, email, credit card, and expiration date. We want to make sure we don't get any bogus orders, so please keep an eye out for any validations and make sure the user knows if there's a problem with the order. We'll add a credit card processor later on, so you don't need to integrate with Stripe. Once the customer purchases their tickets, they should receive an email receipt.

We want to keep track of our sales, so the order information should be saved to the DB. We'll also want to see all of the orders for each movie and an index page showing all of the orders (across all movies). We don't need any authentication on the app.

Since our client is opening the theater, they'll need a way to manage it. They should be able to add different auditorium and seating capacities. In addition, movie titles are changing all the time so our client should be able to set which movie is showing in which auditorium.
We're not worried about custom visual design, so feel free to use any CSS framework, or roll your own. However, we need the site to work on mobile so keep that in mind.

There are many ways to code this challenge, so we'd like to see your thought processes in the app's Readme file. We're hoping that you can finish the challenge within 7 days. Please push your code to Github and deploy the app to Heroku when you're done.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
